## DataGrid for Fabulous.Avalonia

The DataGrid control is a cross-platform view that displays repeating data in a customizable grid. The control can be styled, templated and bound.

The data grid needs to be bound to an observable collection in a view model that can be found in a related data context. Based on AvaloniaU [DataGrid control](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/reference/controls/datagrid/).

### How to use
- Add the `Fabulous.Avalonia.DataGrid` package to your project.
- Open `Fabulous.Avalonia` at the top of the file where you declare your Fabulous program (eg. Program.stateful).

```fsharp
open Fabulous.Aavalonia

open type Fabulous.Avalonia.View
```

#### Using the `DataGrid` Widget

Now you can use the `DataGrid` widget in your Fabulous app as follows:

```fsharp
VStack() {
    AutoGeneratedDataGrid(model.People)

    (DataGrid(model.People) {
        DataGridTextColumn("Name", Binding("Name"))
        DataGridTextColumn(TextBlock("Age"), Binding("Age"))
        DataGridCheckBoxColumn("IsMale", Binding("IsMale"))
    })
        .gridLinesVisibility(DataGridGridLinesVisibility.Horizontal)
        .borderThickness(1.0)
        .borderBrush(SolidColorBrush(Colors.Gray))
}

```
