open Avalonia.Themes.Fluent

open type Fabulous.Avalonia.View

module App =
    type Model =
        { Count: int; Step: int; TimerOn: bool }

    type Msg =
        | Increment
        | Decrement
        | Reset
        | SetStep of float
        | TimerToggled of bool
        | TimedTick

    let initModel = { Count = 0; Step = 1; TimerOn = false }

    let timerCmd () =
        async {
            do! Async.Sleep 200
            return TimedTick
        }
        |> Cmd.OfAsync.msg

    let init () = initModel, Cmd.none

    let update msg model =
        match msg with
        | Increment ->

## Getting Started

You can start your new Fabulous.Avalonia app in a matter of seconds using the dotnet CLI templates.  
For a starter guide see our [Get Started with Fabulous.Avalonia](https://docs.fabulous.dev/avalonia/get-started).

## How to use the templates

Using the dotnet CLI, install the templates:

```sh
dotnet new install Fabulous.Avalonia.Templates
```

Then, you will be able to create new Fabulous.Avalonia projects with `dotnet new`:

#### Single Project

Single project takes the platform-specific development experiences and abstracts them into a single shared project that can target Android, iOS, Desktop.

```sh
dotnet new fabulous-avalonia -n MyApp
```

```tree
MyApp
├── Platform
    ├── Android
    ├── iOS
    └── Desktop
```

Note: Browser is not supported in single project template.

#### Multi Project

Multi project takes the platform-specific development and abstracts them into a multiple projects that can target Android, iOS, Desktop, Browser.

```sh
dotnet new fabulous-avalonia-multi -n MyApp
```

```tree
MyApp
├── MyApp
├── MyApp.Android
├── MyApp.iOS
├── MyApp.Desktop
└── MyApp.Browser
```

net8.0-ios is not supported on Linux, thus net8.0-ios is excluded from build on a Linux host.

## Samples
We have a range of samples to help you get started.

You can find them in the [sample's repo](https://github.com/fabulous-dev/Fabulous.Avalonia.Samples).

## Controls Gallery
To run the `Gallery` sample app from the command line:

- This will restore the required workloads for the samples

```shell
dotnet workload restore
```

- Then you can run the Gallery sample

```shell
cd samples/Gallery
dotnet run -f net8.0
```

You can also open the solution `Fabulous.Avalonia.sln` with your favorite IDE(We recommend [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)) and select the platform you want, then press debug to deploy and run the app.
