## Getting Started

You can start your new Fabulous.Avalonia app in a matter of seconds using the dotnet CLI templates.  
For a starter guide see our [Get Started with Fabulous.Avalonia](https://docs.fabulous.dev/avalonia/get-started).

## How to use the templates

Using the dotnet CLI, install the templates:

```sh
dotnet new install Fabulous.Avalonia.Templates
```

Then, you will be able to create new Fabulous.Avalonia projects with `dotnet new`:

#### Desktop Project

Desktop project is a standard Avalonia project that can target Desktop platforms only.

```sh
dotnet new fabulous-avalonia-desktop -n MyApp
```

#### Single Project

Single project takes the platform-specific development experiences and abstracts them into a single shared project that can target Android, iOS, Desktop.

```sh
dotnet new fabulous-avalonia -n MyApp
```

- MyApp
    - Platform
        - Android
        - iOS
        - Desktop

Note: Browser is not supported in single project template.

#### Multi Project

Multi project takes the platform-specific development and abstracts them into a multiple projects that can target Android, iOS, Desktop, Browser.

```sh
dotnet new fabulous-avalonia-multi -n MyApp
```

- MyApp
    - MyApp
    - MyApp.Android
    - MyApp.iOS
    - MyApp.Desktop
    - MyApp.Browser

net8.0-ios is not supported on Linux, thus net8.0-ios is excluded from build on a Linux host.

## Samples
We have a range of samples to help you get started.

You can find them in the [samples repo](https://github.com/fabulous-dev/Fabulous.Avalonia.Samples).
